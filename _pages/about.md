Hi! I'm <ins>Surya</ins> Kiran , Research Fellow at [Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron](https://www.desy.de/) and [Universty of Federal Armed Forces](https://www.hsu-hh.de/en/), Hamburg, Germany. I am a multidisciplinary engineer/scientist with background in Aerospace/Mechanical/Marine Engineering. My experience includes working with high fidelity CFD simulations and modeling (finite volumes method) and also lagrangian based methods such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). My current research focuses on developing advanced simulation methodologies to resolve fluid flows having wide range of flow states (e.g., continuum and free molecular flows) and its interaction with nano particles. This involves bundling different multiscale and multiphysics simulation methodologies supported by high-performance computing and data science methods. 

I firmly believe in open science and constantly working to intergrate opensource solutions in to my workflow. I created this website to communicate science and research.
