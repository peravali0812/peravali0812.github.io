In the pockets of my free time, I immerse myself in the simple joys of life. Chess, a game of strategy and contemplation, holds a special place in my heart.

Music, my ever-present companion, finds expression through the soulful tunes of the harmonica and the melodic keys of the piano. These instruments are my partners in creating moments of serenity and rhythm.

The boundless worlds of science fiction lure me into captivating stories, offering a welcome escape from reality.

Amidst the challenges of pandemic days, I discovered solace in the rhythmic pattern of long-distance running, where every step becomes a journey of self-discovery.

Here are some snippets:
