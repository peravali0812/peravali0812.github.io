<h1>Overview</h1>
My current area of research is in developing multiscale simulation methodologies for simulating molecular beam experiments where the gas flow passes through wide Knudsen number range i.e., continuum to rarefied flow regimes.
The continuum regimes are resolved by solving Navier-Stokes equations using a finite volume approach where as the rarefied regimes are resolved solving a Boltzmann equation using Direct simulation monte-carlo (DSMC) approach.
